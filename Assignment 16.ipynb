When you use a web browser to visit a webpage, the browser sends a GET request to the server to retrieve the content of the webpage. GET requests can be cached and bookmarked, and they have length restrictions. They should only be used for retrieving data, not for modifying data on the server.\n",

When you fill out a form on a website and click the submit button, the data from the form is sent to the server using a POST request.
