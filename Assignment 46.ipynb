    "**Concept:**\n",
    "R-squared (coefficient of determination) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation:**\n",
    "1. Calculate the total sum of squares (SST): \\( \\text{SST} = \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 \\), where \\( y_i \\) is the observed value and \\( \\bar{y} \\) is the mean of the observed values.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- R-squared ranges from 0 to 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Complexity of Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - Regularization adds complexity to the model by penalizing coefficients, making interpretation less straightforward compared to traditional linear regression.\n",
    "   - Interpreting the impact of individual predictors on the dependent variable becomes more challenging, especially in Lasso regression where some coefficients are shrunk to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Sensitivity to Hyperparameters:**\n",
    "   - Regularized linear models require tuning of hyperparameters (e.g., regularization parameter lambda) to achieve optimal performance.\n",
    "   - The selection of hyperparameters may be data-dependent and require cross-validation, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Over-reliance on Linearity:**\n",
    "   - Regularized linear models assume a linear relationship between predictors and the dependent variable. If the relationship is non-linear, these models may not capture complex patterns effectively.\n",
    "   - They may underperform when faced with non-linear relationships, leading to biased estimates and poor predictive performance.\n",
