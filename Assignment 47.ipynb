    "# Differences from other regression techniques:\n",
    "# - Lasso Regression differs from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression by adding a penalty term to the objective function,\n",
    "#   which shrinks the coefficients towards zero.\n",
    "# - Unlike Ridge Regression, which uses a penalty term based on the L2 norm, Lasso Regression uses a penalty term based on the L1 norm,\n",
