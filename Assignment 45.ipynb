    "# Q1: Ridge Regression vs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ridge Regression:**\n",
    "Ridge Regression is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in linear regression models. It adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function, which shrinks the coefficients towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences:**\n",
    "1. **Penalty Term:** Ridge Regression adds a penalty term (L2 norm) to the OLS objective function, while OLS does not include any regularization.\n",
    "2. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff:** Ridge Regression introduces bias by shrinking the coefficients, but it reduces variance by reducing model complexity.\n",
    "3. **Tendency to Overfit:** OLS may overfit the data when there are many predictors, while Ridge Regression helps to mitigate overfitting.\n",

    "The assumptions of Ridge Regression are similar to those of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression:\n",

    "1. **Linearity:** The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.\n",
    "2. **Independence:** The residuals (errors) are independent of each other.\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity:** The residuals have constant variance at every level of the independent variable.\n",
    "4. **Normality:** The residuals of the model are normally distributed.\n",

    "**Methods for selecting lambda:**\n",
    "1. **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to evaluate the performance of the model for different values of lambda and select the one with the best performance.\n",
    "2. **Grid Search:** Perform a grid search over a range of lambda values and select the one that gives the best performance on a validation set.\n",
