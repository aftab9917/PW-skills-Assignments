    "# Q1: Elastic Net Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "# Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression that combines the penalties of both Lasso and Ridge regression methods.\n",
    "# It adds two penalty terms to the ordinary least squares objective function: one based on the L1 norm (Lasso penalty) and the other based on the L2 norm (Ridge penalty).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Differences from other regression techniques:\n",
    "# - Elastic Net Regression combines the feature selection capabilities of Lasso Regression with the regularization properties of Ridge Regression.\n",
    "# - Compared to Lasso Regression, which can be sensitive to multicollinearity and may select only one feature from a group of highly correlated features,\n",
    "#   Elastic Net Regression can select groups of correlated features together while still performing feature selection.\n",
    "# - Compared to Ridge Regression, which may not perform well in the presence of a large number of irrelevant features,\n",
    "#   Elastic Net Regression can handle a large number of predictors and automatically select relevant features.\n"
