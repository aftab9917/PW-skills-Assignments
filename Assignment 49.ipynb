Resources are limited to the capacity of the server, and scaling requires upgrading hardware or migrating to a new server.\\n\\nCloud Hosting: Involves hosting a website on virtual servers or containers provided by cloud service providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Resources are scalable on-demand, allowing for flexibility in handling traffic spikes and reducing costs by paying only for what is used.\\n\\nQ3: How do you choose the right cloud provider for your application deployment, and what factors should you consider?\\nPerformance and Scalability: Evaluate the provider's infrastructure capabilities, including network performance, scalability, and availability zones.\\n\\nCost: Compare pricing models, including compute, storage, bandwidth, and additional services.
